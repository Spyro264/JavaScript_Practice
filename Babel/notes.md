# WHAT IS BABEL ?

- Babel is a javascript compiler that transforms modern js into older js that can run in older browsers or environment.
- In other words, it allows you to write modern JS features like arrow functions, classes, template literals, optional chaining, etc., and still support environments that donâ€™t understand them.
